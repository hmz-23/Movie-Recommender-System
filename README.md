# Movie Recommender System
### A Content-based Recommender System using cosine-similarity. This project is a Movie Recommender System that utilizes a content-based approach with cosine similarity. It uses a dataset from Kaggle, specifically the TMDB movie metadata.
### Key Technologies and Concepts:
#### Libraries: NumPy, scikit-learn (sklearn), Pandas, and Pickle for data manipulation, model building, and serialization.
#### Recommendation Techniques: Content-based recommendation and CountVectorizer are central to its functionality.
#### Data Preprocessing: An important step in preparing the data for the recommendation engine.

The system's core functionality is to recommend movies based on their content, leveraging the similarities between movie attributes.
