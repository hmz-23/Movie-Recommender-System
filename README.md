# Movie Recommender System
### A Content-based Recommender System using cosine-similarity. This project is a Movie Recommender System that utilizes a content-based approach with cosine similarity. It uses a dataset from Kaggle, specifically the TMDB movie metadata.
#### Key Technologies and Concepts:

Model: Likely refers to the machine learning model built for recommendations.

Libraries: NumPy, scikit-learn (sklearn), Pandas, and Pickle for data manipulation, model building, and serialization.

Data Structures: DataFrames are used for handling the movie data.

Recommendation Techniques: Content-based recommendation and CountVectorizer are central to its functionality.

Data Preprocessing: An important step in preparing the data for the recommendation engine.

The system's core functionality is to recommend movies based on their content, leveraging the similarities between movie attributes.
